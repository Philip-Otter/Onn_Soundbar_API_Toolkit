# Onn_Soundbar_API_Toolkit
***
## What Am I?
***
One day, while hurling into a bucket on my couch, I noticed that there was an Onn soundbar that was network accessable. Through probing the device, trialing cURL requests, and reading through client side javascript code I put together this small python script to interact with the devices API.

## Requirements
***
- Linux
- Python 3
- cURL

## Tested Devices
***
Onn 5_1_2 Atmos Soundbar

These API interactions may be used for other devices so try it out and let me know! Make a pull request and add to the list of Tested Devices! I'm sure there are more API interactions out there it's just a matter of hunting them down!
